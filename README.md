## 🛡️ User Authentication System – Sharing Task

This project is a **User Authentication System** built with **Django** during my internship. It demonstrates secure login and logout functionality, along with user management through Django’s built-in admin interface.

## 🔐 Features

### For Users:
- Secure **login** and **logout**
- Authentication using **username and password**

### For Admin:
- View all users

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with:
- Django’s **authentication system**
- Managing **user sessions** and permissions
- Using the **Django Admin Panel** for backend operations

Even though it’s a small project, it helped me gain a much deeper understanding of **backend development with Django**.
